# little-rio

When you need just the `RIO` monad (but you want a `MonadCatch` instance and some other orphans)

This is derived from the `rio` library ([LICENSE](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.22.0/src/LICENSE)) and the `rio-orphans` library ([LICENSE](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-orphans-0.1.2.0/src/LICENSE))
